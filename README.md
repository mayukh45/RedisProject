## RedisProject

This is a short application that uses redis as its persistent data store.

#### Functionality:

1) User can add video for a particular topic.
2) User can like a video.
3) User can subscribe to one or more topics.
4) User can see all the videos in all topics subscribed by him/her sorted by number of likes.

#### How to use:
Clone this repo and make a client to consume the application, as given examples in the client folder.

I am using [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis) as my redis client.
